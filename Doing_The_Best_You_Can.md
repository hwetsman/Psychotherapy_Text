<h2><center>YOU’RE JUST DOING THE BEST YOU CAN (AND SO ARE THEY)</h2></center>

A long time ago in China, Lao-Tze wrote:

But luckily for me, it was translated as:
>What is a good man but a bad man’s teacher?
What is a bad man but a good man’s job?

This I can understand. It tells us that our definitions of absolutes, for
example, good and bad aren’t the absolutes we thought. Lao Tze tells us that
good and bad aren’t inherent in things but rather are some things that we can
learn and forget. He tells us that we aren’t statically good or bad, but always
changing: that if we’re learning we’re getting better and if we’re forgetting
we’re not.

Of course this also has implications to the teaching relationship. The teacher
is a good person teaching someone else to be good. He, in turn, learned from
someone else and is still learning. It isn’t so much that teachers and good
people, in general, are any better than students or bad people. It’s just that,
at the moment, they have something to teach.

We’re also reminded that we teach with ourselves not with our knowledge.
Teachers can’t be replaced by books and the interaction with a healer can’t be
replaced with a book on healing. That of course puts a great pressure on
therapists: we’re forced to either address the “goodness” of ourselves or
practice in denial of this important truth.

The patient comes to therapy because it’s the best he can do. If he could have
done it without you he would have. And it’s the same with you. What you say, how
you listen, how you direct your energy in a session is as good as you can do.
You’re just doing the best you can.

I think we would like this not to be true. We’d like to believe we can do
better; it’s just that we need another technique or more experience or something
else. This wish projects us into the future, into a time when we have learned
another way and become more experienced; to a future where we are already a
different person. When we indulge in this wish we are no longer in the room with
the patient or even in our own body with our selves. Instead of accepting that
we are limited by who we are in this moment, we focus on what it will be like
when we’re someone else. When we do that, we actually rob the present of energy
and make it less likely that we’ll be able to effectively change.

Another implication of using ourselves in the therapy is that we can’t rely on
teachers to teach us techniques – doing better doesn’t require learning more,
it requires a becoming. This of course is uncomfortable. We like who we are or
we wouldn’t be us. In our lives there had been no reason to change; then we
become psychotherapists and suddenly our being who we are presents us with
limits. We want to overcome them and be better at this practice. We would rather
do this with a technique than a real change of ourselves. Maybe if we learned
hypnosis or read more books we’d be better. Sorry. As it is true that a stream
can not rise above its source, you can’t take a patient anywhere you haven’t
been.

I apologize if you can no longer sit comfortably with the delusion that you are
healthier than the patient, and that by applying techniques you can make him
well. But after all:

man’s job?
