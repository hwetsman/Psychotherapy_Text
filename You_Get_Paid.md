 <h2><center>YOU’RE THE ONE GETTING PAID</h2></center>

We’ve looked at how to do therapy and how not to, what your patient needs and
what he doesn’t, but we haven’t looked at why we do therapy. What’s the point of this work? Again we have to fall back on the teachings of many schools of therapy. Some focus on cognitive processes while others focus on emotions. Some are experiential while others tend to the didactic. What they all have in common is that they all seek to increase the patient’s freedom.

This freedom can come in many forms, but basically it is the freedom from
extraneous expectations and freedom to accept whatever is found in the therapy. So, the purpose of therapy is to help the patient change what is not their true self and to accept the true self they find. Of course, if this is the goal of psychotherapy, we would expect that it is a long standing goal and might even predate therapy as a profession. I think it does:

“God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change, The courage to change the things I can,
And the wisdom to know the difference.”

Serenity, courage, wisdom: that’s your job; that’s why you’re getting paid. And
it’s important to remember that you are the one getting paid.

If the patient had enough of their own serenity, courage, and wisdom, they
wouldn’t need you. It is your job to lend them some. This echoes the concept of “ego lending” in supportive psychotherapy, but I think it is broader that that. In fact, even when we don’t think we are engaging in ego lending we are; if we are doing good psychotherapy, lending something. Even in the neutrality that is a core feature of classical analysis, we are modeling serenity and therefore lending the patient some of ours. Serenity is a good place to start.

What would psychotherapy be like without serenity? It would be action instead of
clear thinking. The therapist would act on his feelings as they happened without the calm to wait and see. Those actions would bring about an automatic response from the patient and result in spiraling downhill course of alternating automatic actions and reactions. It is just such situations that drive people to therapy in the first place.

When our patients give us material which brings up a feeling of immediate
actions, it is most important to have a quiet place inside in which to evaluate this. This doesn’t mean that you will not act, but only that you will act from your principles and not automatic responses. Many patients come to psychotherapy without this serenity. They tempt us to give it up. If we do we have failed a major test. If we choose to keep our serenity however, we have a chance to model for the patient a different way to respond. We can lend him some of our serenity until he recognizes his own. Sometimes this is hard.

Hard things are common in therapy and while physical courage is less commonly
necessary, the courage to tackle the hard work is always necessary. What would psychotherapy be like without courage? The therapist would collude with the patient’s fear of painful issues. He would validate that they are indeed too painful to face, too shameful to overcome. This validation would bring about even more anxiety and fear in the patient. It is because of such fear and anxiety that many people seek therapy in the first place.

When our patients bring us material which is naturally uncomfortable, it is
important for us to have the courage to face this material. This does not mean that we are numb to the feelings aroused in us by the material; if we were numb, we would not need courage. It also doesn’t mean that we force the patient to give us the material, only that we show the courage necessary to be willing to listen. That example of courage will model the behavior and we will be lending the patient a little of our own courage until he can find more of his own.

This courage is a necessary thing because the outcome is not always rosy. If we
could promise that everything will be all right, the patient would not need courage. That of course, isn’t the truth. There is danger in therapy, danger to the patient and danger to the therapist. We cannot do this work and remain unchanged, and we cannot predict in advance the nature of that change. We must therefore have the courage to embrace that change and leap into it without knowing that there is something on the other side to catch us. Of course, there is a line between courage and foolhardiness. To know where that line is requires wisdom.

What would psychotherapy be without wisdom? The therapist would have no capacity
to time his interventions or be able to judge which of them will benefit the patient and which will harm. The patient of course would benefit from some but would be so hurt by others that he would become more tentative and eventually leave this therapist who is blind to the consequences of his own actions. It is such blindness which brings many people to therapy in the first place.

We are smart people. When our patients bring us material which can, on one level,
be given a facile response by the average smart person; we must hold our tongue. We are smart people, but we aren’t the only ones. If the patient just needed the advice of a smart person, he’d have found one already. By understanding that there is more to the situation than there seems on the surface we model for the patient the ability to see the latent meaning in words and actions. We lend him our ability to do this. This is wisdom.
