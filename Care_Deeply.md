CHAPTER FOUR
CARE DEEPLY...HOLD LIGHTLY

This is a concept from Zen and I’m sure the Zen masters of old will not mind my
paraphrasing. While they care deeply for the words they’ve written they hold them lightly, allowing me to change them.

To Care Deeply... This is what the patient needs, to be held in unconditional
regard. Not for you to agree with him or infantilize him or gratify his wishes, but to hold him in unconditional high regard.

The patient doesn’t need a technique for this, but you might. If you try to
substitute a technique instead of genuine regard you will not likely get the result you hoped for. But in order to hold the patient in genuine high regard you may need the help of some technique.

What if you can’t hold the patient in high regard? Transfer the case. No amount
of good technique or supervision will help a therapy when you do not have unconditional regard for the patient.

To Hold Lightly...As we discussed in the last chapter, the patient is there for
himself. He needs to leave when he needs to leave. When you need him to leave is not an issue. It is difficult to hold lightly someone we care about. It is difficult to lose an person who has become important to us as often happens when we say good-bye to patients.

This necessary loss of the patient is something which seems difficult about our
work. We meet the patient, help him grow, begin to feel great care for him, and then at a time not of our own choosing, let him go. One has to ask, “who in his right mind would go into such work voluntarily?” The answer is simple: no one. None of us enter this work voluntarily. None of us come to this job of growing intimacy and letting go of it because we already like the process. We come because we have no choice – it is the nature of life to have partings. The alternative of meaningless partings leaves us empty and lethargic. We come to this work because that is the way it is. It is life. The patient comes because it is life. If we can’t care deeply and hold lightly, how will our patients learn to?

As therapists we should be accomplished at the art of caring deeply and holding
lightly. In the appendix, there are some exercises to practice this art.
