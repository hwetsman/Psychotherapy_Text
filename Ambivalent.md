IF THEY WEREN’T AMBIVALENT THEY WOULDN’T NEED YOU...
It’s a common frustration that once patients enter treatment and a treatment
contract has been negotiated, that they seem to have difficulty holding to their end of the bargain. It’s not uncommon for a new counselor (or even an old one for that matter) to come to his supervisor with the complaint, “He doesn’t seem to want to get better.”

Of course, all the schools of therapy address this “resistance” and the
mechanisms used by patients to express it; what to do about this phenomenon differs from school to school. Some maintain it should be confronted, some that it should be ignored, some say eradicated, and some bypassed. There are even schools of therapy which maintain that resistance should be utilized. While this view comes quite close to accepting the patients as they are, the term “resistance” is still a problem. Even though it is couched in psychological language, resistance still means something negative to the layman. Remember, we were all laymen first, and usually in our most formative years. Since I was a layman once, and for almost as long as I’ve been a therapist, the term resistance still raises a negative picture for me.

Resistance to therapy, if therapy is good for you, can’t possible be good. It’s
like not taking your medicine or not doing your rehab exercises. You can’t get better if you are resisting. That makes sense, right? That’s what I thought. And my patients proved me right. Since everyone had resistance, and no on got better.

Being a compulsive type who doesn’t like failure I got tired of no one getting
better. I could tell you all the things I did to succeed in the face of all this resistance, but I’d like to keep this a short book. So, in short, as soon as I stopped believing in resistance my patients got better.

But then I had another problem; what was I going to call what everyone else
called resistance? I decided to call it normal. Since we don’t actually make people better by doing something to them, I figured that patients must get themselves well. Since they get themselves well, why do they need me? I didn’t really want to talk myself out of a job, so I kept thinking.

Our patients are a self selected group. They are basically saying that they have
difficulty engaging themselves in recovery, we can’t expect a simple or straightforward course. We already know that the patients get themselves well, but they aren’t doing it before they come to therapy. They are a group that has the capacity for self healing but for some reason at this point they cannot or will not mobilize this capacity. On the other hand, if they had no motivation to engage this capacity for change, they’d never have come to therapy. In short, if they weren’t ambivalent, they wouldn’t need you.

Let me put it another way. I’ve heard more than once from a trainee, “We could
be doing great things in this therapy if it weren’t for the patient’s resistance.” This attitude reminds me of a story I heard about the bus system of a major metropolitan area. It seems that the company was having trouble getting the buses to run on time, so they hired a very expensive, but very good, efficiency consulting firm to figure out why. The consultants did a very thorough job. They talked to the drivers and the mechanics; they spoke to the executives and the secretaries; they rode the buses taking notes and making calculations. Finally, after about six months they had found the answer. It seems that every time the bus stopped, passengers got on. The company could control every variable but this. No one could say or predict how long it would take the passengers to get on; how many old ladies would drop their purses fumbling for change. In short everything would work fine if it weren’t for the passengers. So like the bus line that needs passengers (however inefficient), if it wasn’t for the patient’s ambivalence you’d be out of a job. And that leads us to our next chapter.
