>“The truth that can be written is not the eternal truth”
>      –Lao Tzu


The two quotations above are essential to remember when working with patients.
This book assumes that you are a student of counseling and that you have had a
basic course. If so, that basic course taught you the techniques and boundaries
of psychotherapy. These techniques are your map, and this book does not erase
that map.

The map is necessary for the beginner (and sometimes the master). It gives us
grounding in the correct path, and it helps us navigate an area where we’ve
never been before. As we go over that ground again and again we’ll need the map
less and less. We may even put it away for a while. Later we many come back to
it when we begin a new venture or find another area to explore. We may even
refer to it if we know the terrain but haven’t been there for a while.

This book is not intended to replace the map or tell you that you don’t need the
map. Instead, the message is that while you are working with a patient, you and
the patient are not walking on the map. The map exists for you; it teaches you
techniques you need so you don’t lose your way. The patient doesn’t need the map
to get better. It’s you who need the map, at least for now, to do the
counseling.

Now for the warning: I can’t write the truth. I’m writing and you’re reading my
truth. You may find something useful here; you may not. In either case you’ll
have experienced another person’s truth and that will have brought you closer to
your own.
