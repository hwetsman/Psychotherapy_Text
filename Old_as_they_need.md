CHAPTER FIVE
EVERYONE’S AS OLD AS THEY NEED TO BE

We all get angry at the patient who isn’t “acting his age.” We label as
“immature” behaviors common to early levels of development. We describe a hierarchical progress in development from earlier to later stages. This hierarchical structure is very helpful to us in describing our ideas about in what way the patient is ill and about how he got that way. I other words, it’s helpful in making a diagnosis.

As helpful as this model is we should keep in mind it is only a model. No one
has found the gene for the oral stage; there is no latency hormone. These stages are a creation of man so that man can understand nature. It’s important to remember the patients don’t need these stages to be ill- we need them to help us understand.

The patient brings to the therapy the entire history of his life to that point.
With each joy and sorrow a part of him is changed and the echoes of those changes can still be heard. It is these echoes that are the essence of the therapeutic communication. The first echo we will hear will be the one that brings the patient to be a patient at this point in his life. If is not necessarily the most important echo, or the loudest, buy only the one that has brought him to this here and this now.

As schools of therapy have developed techniques, they discovered that certain
techniques were most useful for patients with certain defensive structures. They also found certain developmental necessities for patients’ participation in these techniques. Within these schools, there arose a sense that some patients were not treatable; some were too underdeveloped or lacked skills necessary to be treated. In effect, that some were too young to be treated.

This is, as you can see, a limitation of the technique, not the patient. An
alternative way to approach the assessment is to view the patient’s arrival as the echo of what brought him here. Is there a message in this patient’s arrival? Why does he present for psychotherapy with “primitive” defense mechanisms – why come to therapy and look so untreatable? Once we let go of our particular schools and our particular technique we find ourselves asking about this person and not about his defensive structure.

And far from being simple, this person is complex. He arrives not just with one
echo but with many echoes, all rebounding against the walls of his life, setting up harmonics and sub-harmonics which provide the theme music to his relationships. The answer to our simple question, “why is he here?” will not be so simple in the long run. We might not be able to distinguish the individual echoes, but we can perhaps hear the theme.

An example: A 22 year old single man presents with the chief complaint of
“nothing’s ever right for me.” Listening to his story we learn that his early and later life are equal examples of chaotic interpersonal relationships. We hear that the patient has had difficulty with every authority figure in his life and that he has essentially no accomplishments on which to base a feeling of self respect. On the face of it, not a promising therapy case; a patient with poor interpersonal skills and difficulty with authority figures in not likely to develop a good working relationship with his psychotherapist. Yet, there is one promising sign: he’s here. He doesn’t bring a mature defensive structure but then again, that’s probably not what he needs to or wants to work on most. The theme he has presented is his aloneness, his utter lack of company and intimacy in the world. That is the pain he wants treated, and he presents as old as he needs to be for dealing with this problem.

In a case such as this it is important not to impose our own wishes on the
patient. We might feel that he needs a long character changing psychotherapy in order to be happy. We might even feel he needs to be happy. All of that is in our imagination.

The patient comes for what he wants and needs and brings with him what is
necessary to communicate that to you. He brings with him everything he needs to get done what he needs done. He may not bring with him the skills or the maturity to do the therapy that you want to do- but that would have to be your problem wouldn’t it?
