YOU’RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OUTCOME


Well, there’s a heretical thought. Few patients starting treatment would agree
with that, probably even fewer malpractice attorneys. The reason others want us to be responsible for the outcome, and why we as a profession have to some extent accepted it, has to do with the origins of psychological treatment in the medical model.

A surgeon for instance has a great deal of control over the patient. The patient
is asleep and paralyzed. When Freud was learning medicine the ability to put a surgery patient to sleep was less than 20 years old. Physicians were ecstatic about this new found control. Finally! To be able to do a real procedure without any trashing about. Freud’s first attempts with hypnosis might be seen to be an imitation of that.

While psychotherapy theory has moved in a direction that allows more patient
autonomy and ‘trashing about’, the rest of medicine has become more procedure and control oriented. In fact the outcome of most medical procedures has become so dependent on the physician’s control of the patient we’ve come to confuse this control with the physician’s technique. While a cardiologist has both the technique to do an invasive procedure and the ability to sedate the patient during the procedure, the psychotherapist is left with doing an invasive procedure without anesthesia. Few of our patients or our non-therapist
colleagues recognize this.

We don’t have total control over the environment of care. We have a very short
time with the patient and then he returns to his life. While it is true that the patient can’t actually change what was said in a session, he may change his perception of what you said and of what he said. We’ve all experienced the frustration of having patients come back over and over again to do the same work, something they seemed to understand after the first time. Since we aren’t privy to what goes on in the patient’s life outside of the session, we can’t know what gets undone in between the few moments we have with him. And of course we aren’t responsible for what the patient does in between sessions. We are only responsible for what we say and do: our technique. This brings me to the other reason I say you aren’t responsible for the outcome.

It wouldn’t work anyway. To feel responsible for something you can’t control is
usually ineffective. While you are responsible for you technique, it’s impossible to pay attention to both outcome and technique. While we’re worrying about the outcome we won’t be able to pay attention to the patient and paying attention to the patient is our technique. Imagine that you’re driving while thinking about your destination. You might get where you are going but it will certainly be more hazardous than it needs to be. If you do focus on outcome your therapy may end up wrapped around a tree. It’s actually more likely to get the outcome you want if you focus on what you’re doing instead. If we are thinking about the outcome we literally cannot hear what the patient is saying - it is as if we aren’t even in the room.

As necessary as it is to let go of these thoughts of the outcome, we find there
is something uncomfortable about just “being with” the patient. Letting go of the outcome to focus on being here and now with the patient means letting go of what we see as control. It means admitting that outcome is not exactly the same thing as technique. It means knowing that even if you do everything right, something else might go wrong. It means acknowledging that the patient is not asleep, that he’s active in the process, and has some power to determine the course of treatment. Since all this is true whether we accept it or not, focusing in the “here and now” really means letting go of our illusion of control. Letting go of illusions usually carries some discomfort.

Recognizing the reality of the situation means we recognize that we are not
omnipotent. We don’t control the disease any more than the patient does. We’re not God any more than the patient is. We’re faced with the reality that a lot of the control is in the hands of the person asking us to help with what’s going on. Kind of feels like driving with another person’s hands on the wheel, doesn’t it? Who in their right mind would want to do this work?

The answer, unfortunately, can’t be in this book. If you are working with addicts you are probably struggling for that answer. You’ll find it. The Truth is already there, inside you. As you focus on the moment you are in with the patient, in those quiet alert moments of mindfulness, you’ll know why you’re there or rather, here.
