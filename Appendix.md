Meditating –

If you already know how to get into a meditative state that’s great. If you don’t, here are some hints.
The practice of meditation is as varied as the practices of therapy. It doesn’t matter though if you’re sitting, standing, walking or anything else. Meditation is a mindfulness of what is. It can be mindfulness of breathing or stepping or jumping rope. What matters is not what form of meditation you practice as much as that you are being aware and mindful of what is.

Find a quiet place where you won’t be interrupted and set a timer for the amount of time you want to meditate. Later you won’t need the timer, but as you start it may help you let go of thinking about how long you’ve been meditating. Get comfortable and focus your attention on something that won’t go away. As you turn your mind to that thing you’ll find that it will wander off. Don’t force it back. Just gently acknowledge to yourself that it’s wandered and laughingly and lovingly put it back on the original thing.

If this is hard at first, it sometimes helps to meditate remotely. Instead of watching your breathing or a candle, imagine yourself outside of your body watching yourself watch your breathing or a candle. You can keep going back a third, fourth or however many steps you need to feel comfortable.

Finding Unconditional Regard – After entering a meditative state you can change the object you’re mindful of from whatever it is to your patient. In your mind’s eye, focus on your patient. See him as he is. Of course, your mind will again wander. Just give a little inside chuckle and gently bring your attention back to the image of the patient. As you look, see the patient in the context of their lives as you know them. See them at work and at home. See them in therapy. Let yourself experience these settings from the point of view of your patient. If you find yourself doing more than developing positive regard, if you find yourself identifying with the patient bring your attention back to yourself and watch yourself focus on the patient.

Saying Good-bye – In a meditative state turn your attention to the thing or person you need to let go. As you see each quality, liked and unliked, in that person, say good- bye to it. Continue to watch as each quality passes in front of your attention. Hold each as long as it takes to really say good-bye. Saying good-bye to each little piece of a thing is doable sometimes when saying good-bye to the whole thing isn’t.


Being Here –

If, in a session, you find that you’ve gotten away from the here and now or gotten caught up in your own issues, tell the patient that you have. Say that you want to be here with them to help and you’d like to take a minute to clear yourself and get back to them. Take the time you need, there in the session, to get back to there here and now. Breath deeply and regularly watching and attending to your breathing. Let go of whatever dragged you away from the patient. When you are back, thank the patient for their patience with you and resume the session. Rather than being seen by the patient as an interruption, your modeling of how to stay in the now will be seen as a lesson by most patients.
