<center><h2>CHAPTER NINE</h2></center>
<center><h2>...EXCEPT, NOBODY’S TREATABLE</h2></center>

It’s a literary conceit to name a chapter exactly the opposite of the one before.
It sows confusion and makes the reader want to read further for an explanation. If that is the case with you, I want to let you know right away that it’s just a trick and you don’t need to read any further. If, however, you want to read more please continue.

It’s pretty obvious by now that I believe that patients in psychotherapy heal
themselves. This leads to several questions such as, “Why don’t they get better without us,” and “What is it we’re doing while they’re healing.” What I’d like to do here is to wrap up these questions. Like most things that we believe are different, it turns out that all these different questions are really the same, or at least, they all have the same answer.

I think that answer, or at least the reason we don’t see it, lies in the medical
concept of treatment. Our Western medicine is based on fixing what’s wrong, it assumes a defect in functioning. Something must be killed (bacteria), removed (tumor), or added (medication). All these things are treatments. In all these things we do something to patients to make them better.

When I was a kid I was taken for allergy shots. Once every week or two I went to
the doctor’s office to get a treatment. It was completely irrelevant if my mind went with me, all they wanted there was my body to get the shot. My only participation was in holding still.

It’s pretty clear that this is not an adequate model of psychotherapy. For us
there is at least a participatory therapy and in that sense it can be said that we are not giving anyone a “treatment”. Therefore no one is “treatable” with psychotherapy. At this point of course the argument sounds rather silly and seems to be mere word play so let’s go a little further.

Remember we in the west need a disease to treat or a defect to fix. The concept
of defect certainly goes a long way to explain why patients don’t spontaneously get better without therapy (if in fact they don’t). If the patient has a defect that therapy fixes the patient needs therapy before they’ll get better. This has been such an obvious state of affairs that it has been taken at face value by every school of psychotherapy: “There’s something wrong with the patient”.

As obvious as this is to the western mind, it is not without it side effects. If
there is something wrong that therapy fixes we should be able to reduce that something down to its exact specification and apply the correct treatment that is specific for that defect. This wish has led much of psychiatry and even a lot of psychotherapy moving away from its original vision. By original vision I don’t mean that of Freud’s; I mean that which existed before him and for as long as mankind has looked to healers for help.

For a contrasting view let us assume that there is nothing what so ever wrong
with the patient. Let us assume that his current unhappy state is the result of ongoing pressure, rather that to any defect inherent in his original self. Let us also define those outside forces to include even those learned by the patient and applied to himself. We can then, conceptualize the patient not as a sphere with a chunk gouged out needing something from the outside to fill it in, but rather an elastic sphere actively deformed by an energy requiring process.

We might see then that the process of therapy is not to apply energy to the
system to heal a defect but to stop applying energy to the system so as to let it return to its natural state. This might be conceptualized as “doing non doing” and I hope to show you that is exactly what we do in psychotherapy.

Can this alternative view explain why people don’t get better by themselves? I
think so. As we grow we get input from many different sources; these sources will be of varying degrees of intensity, trauma, and intent; some around us wish to help while others may see us only as a means to their own ends. Regardless of the source or intent of these instructors they teach us about survival in the man made world in which we live. We learn by various means to incorporate or in other ways take in the methods of our teachers and we make them our own.

These ways hold us in good stead for a while, while we are still in the
environment they were meant for. But as our internal and external environment change we find ourselves attached to these teachings by fear. It is this fear and these teaching which we are the force that maintains the perturbation of our original selves. Without the fear we would spontaneously let go of the teachings that no longer apply to us; we would spontaneously get better.

What is the fear we have? It is the fear of loss of this important teaching and
teacher. No matter how much trouble a teaching or concept has caused us it is still a comfortable old friend. We took it on because we were not sure we could survive without it. We are still afraid that without it we will not survive. It is survival fear; who in their right mind would let go of something they felt was keeping them alive?

This is where the therapist’s “doing non doing” is healing. By modeling
non-attachment and non-action the therapist shows the patient that for someone the fear is not necessary. By having unconditional regard, the therapist shows the patient’s original self is acceptable and need not fear rejection.

There are some testable effects of this way of looking at patients that you can
go out into your life and examine. If I’m right, most people only need to be
exposed to someone able to do what I’ve described to get better. Can you find examples of this? There will be times when people have sudden life changing events when they feel their old fears fall away – they will spontaneously remodel themselves after this. Can you find examples of this? Some people will have a “spiritual cure” and begin to get better without formal therapy by involving themselves in community and service (12 step programs, church, others). Can you find an example of this?

Mostly, we don’t get better by ourselves because we are actively attached to our
past and our teachers. In our day to day life this is reinforced as the correct way to be. We are so busy being culturally normal that we may get ill. In this case we need a life changing event or another person to help us see a different road. What that helpful person does is to be in the same place and time with us and refrain from harm including the harm of requiring us to participate in a technique designed for their comfort.

So you see that what we do as therapists is “doing non-doing”. I’m sure you’ve
also noticed that to be a good psychotherapist requires more knowledge of self than of technique. Your journey is just beginning; the funny thing is, so is mine, and it always will be.
