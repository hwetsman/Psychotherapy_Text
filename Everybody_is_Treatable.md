<center><h2>EVERYBODY’S TREATABLE...</center></h2>

In our modern paradigm diagnosis dictates treatment. The American Psychiatric
Association has developed the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Revision IV (DSM-IV) which can best be described as a sophisticated non-theoretical diagnostic nomenclature that can be tested against various therapies to find which is best for a given disorder. Boy, that’s a mouthful. In such an approach therapies and diagnoses can be standardized so that healing can be reduced to finding the correct therapy for the patient’s diagnosis. Such a system is helpful in distributing interventions across a spectrum of professions, each able and specialized to do its part optimally. For example, instead of a suffer with a problem, we can reduce the patient to a series of diagnoses, some of which might require the services of a psychiatrist for medical treatment, a psychologist for therapy, and perhaps a social worker for therapy or community services. Such a system promotes a team approach which holds the great promise of universal mental health care for all diagnoses. The problem is: diagnoses don’t come for treatment, people do.

Such a system also had side effects. If each patient is reduced to a diagnosis
for which there is a specified treatment, what do we do with the patient whose diagnosis is untreatable? Past attempts to create such diagnostic/therapeutic systems have always led to a group for whom the therapy or therapies don’t work. These patients have awaited new therapies, or just continued in their misery.

At one point in time there were no psychotherapies but analysis, and no
effective drug therapy at all. Several types of patients who find relief in today’s world would have been deemed untreatable in that scheme. It was not adherence to old theories which brought about new treatments but challenges, challenges which came from those who did not accept that there were some beyond their help.

Our new non-theoretical approach gives us untreatable patients as well.
Treatment resistant cases or patients with complicating co-morbid conditions are much harder to treat and may even be untreatable by the average clinician. As we define an illness, we create the need to change some diagnostic criteria in order to consider the patient better. If a treatment can’t “cure” an illness, it is seen as having little or no role. In that light, we’ve defined some conditions in such a way that they are by definition untreatable with psychotherapy. For instance what is the role of the therapist in schizophrenia? It isn’t to cure schizophrenia. That by itself doesn’t mean that there is no benefit from psychotherapy.

With this non-theoretical model we reduce the patient to the diagnosis and with
that we reduce our own ability to help to the treatment of choice for that diagnosis. If someone has a Bipolar Disorder I can only help with mood stabilizers. If someone has treatment resistant Major Depression I should refer them to a psychopharmacologist or at least, follow the augmentation strategies laid out in the literature. If someone is mentally retarded, there’s nothing I can do but treat their behavior.

As long as the goal of treatment is the change of diagnosis, or rather the
absence of criteria necessary for the diagnosis, we will have to say that psychotherapy can only be an adjunctive intervention in most cases. In many cases it need not play a role at all. If I treat a patient with Prozac for depression and he gets better, I’ve healed him and didn’t need therapy at all. However, the patient hasn’t necessarily learned to accept what he cannot change about himself, or changed what he could, or figured out how to tell the difference. Instead he’s learned he’s mentally ill, needful of outside biological intervention and can be made to feel better without any change on his part. Well, I guess that’s progress.

Obviously there is a great need for psychobiologic interventions and many fine
practitioners who have the requisite skill and knowledge to apply pharmacology in a dynamically mindful way. If the goal of psychotherapy is to make the diagnosis go away; then not everyone is treatable with it. If we keep in mind to goal of the last chapter, then everyone can benefit.
