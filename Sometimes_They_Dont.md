If it wasn’t for the patient’s ambivalence we’d be out of a job. Well, we like
this job or we wouldn’t want to do it. We like being needed and helping others; people who don’t, generally don’t learn to be therapists.

So, liking this job and being human, we might find ourselves fostering the
ambivalence that makes it necessary. Fostering this ambivalence makes it difficult to end a therapy and also difficult to look for solutions besides therapy. We might fall into the trap of asking our patients to fit our prescribed idea for help instead of finding the right prescription for the patient. Let’s look at the first interaction with the patient and see how that might be influenced by our prescription.

I’ve said that being a therapy patient is sufficient evidence of need and
motivation for change. For the most part that’s true, but we live in a time when our referrals come from a number of diverse and sometime unorthodox sources. We still get the typical referrals from other health-care professionals, but we’re getting an increasing number from Oprah. Since most of our referrals come from people who don’t know us or our work, our patients come to us uninformed about what we do. They are uninformed about treatment.

Since we do treatment all the time, it’s easy for us to forget that the patient
doesn’t have our training. The patient comes to us with a problem; he’s heard we fix those. He doesn’t know how we do it or what’s expected of him. Many times he doesn’t even know exactly why he’s coming to us. It’s a big mistake, and a common one, to assume that because someone comes in asking for therapy that he knows what he wants and it’s good for him.

At the first interaction between healer and patient there is a necessary chaos
arising from the fact that the patient does not know what the healer does and the healer does not know what the patient needs. The first interaction is like a dance when each try to find out what he doesn’t know. This dance can be uncomfortable for both. For the patient there is the sense of being a small supplicant, hopeful that the healer can help but frightened that they can’t. For the therapist there is the frustrating sense of wanting to help, being asked to help and not know how.

Unfortunately it is very comfortable for us to prematurely decide what the
patient needs. Of course, it also helps if what the patient needs is something we have to offer. Believing that, we become transformed: where we were once feeling inadequate and useless we now feel competent and necessary.

Both the patient and the healer find this premature conclusion attractive. The
patient can let go of his fear of being untreatable and use his hope to propel
him into a “flight into health.” The healer can set aside his uncertainties about himself and begin the work confident that he’s doing the right thing.

You’ve noticed, I’m sure, that I’ve started using the word healer instead of therapist. The word “healer” reminds us that in the first session we are not yet therapists. The patient has come to a healer with a problem. It has yet to be determined whether psychotherapy is the correct prescription. This means that it is a critical part of being a therapist to know other ways of helping – it’s important to be a healer first.

Moving on, let’s say we’ve begun psychotherapy with a patient who needed the
treatment. How do we know when to stop? Remember, we like this work and are human. We don’t want it to end. It feels good to know that we’re needed and we’re helping. Here are these two humans caught in this therapy. One doesn’t want to leave because of gratitude and the other because of gratification. How do we set them free?

Unfortunately, if you find yourself in this struggle you frankly need help and
supervision beyond the scope of this book. Hopefully, what this book will do is inspire you and teach you how not to get in the situation in the first place. How do you do that? By remembering your technique and at least 95% of that technique is just “being here.” If you’re really here with the patient you won’t be caught up in your thinking about how much you’re helping or how good this feels. If you’re really there with the patient you won’t use the patient for you own gratification.

If that sounds too simple, just wait; it gets simpler. In this and the previous chapter we looked at what patients need and what they don’t. Now it’s time to synthesize these two.
